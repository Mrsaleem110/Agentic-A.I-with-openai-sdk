The OpenAI SDK refers to a suite of official software development kits provided by OpenAI, designed to facilitate seamless integration of OpenAI's AI models and services into various applications. These SDKs offer developers structured tools and interfaces to interact with models like GPT-4, DALLÂ·E, Whisper, and Codex, enabling functionalities such as text generation, image creation, speech recognition, and code completion.([Medium][1])

### ðŸ”§ Official OpenAI SDKs

#### 1. **OpenAI Python SDK**

The OpenAI Python SDK provides a convenient interface to access OpenAI's REST API from Python applications. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, allowing developers to perform tasks like generating text completions, creating images, and transcribing audio.([GitHub][2], [Medium][1])

**Key Features:**

* Supports models such as `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
* Enables text generation, image creation, and audio transcription.
* Offers both synchronous and asynchronous client interfaces.
* Automatically reads API keys from environment variables.([GitHub][2], [OpenAI Platform][3])

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install openai
```



**Example Usage:**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can I use OpenAI's SDK?"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message['content'])
```



For more details, refer to the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).([GitHub][2])

#### 2. **OpenAI Agents SDK**

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a Python framework that enables developers to build AI applications capable of making decisions and taking actions. It allows the creation of agents that can use tools, delegate tasks, and maintain conversational context.([DataCamp][4], [OpenAI GitHub][5])

**Core Concepts:**

* **Agents**: LLMs equipped with instructions and tools.
* **Tools**: Functions that agents can call to perform actions like web searches or API calls.
* **Handoffs**: Mechanisms for transferring control between specialized agents.
* **Guardrails**: Safety measures that validate inputs and outputs to ensure appropriate behavior.
* **Sessions**: Automatic management of conversation history across agent runs.([OpenAI GitHub][5], [DataCamp][4])

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```



**Hello World Example:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")

result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(result.final_output)
```

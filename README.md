🧠 Agentic AI with OpenAI SDK (Python)
This project demonstrates an Agentic AI architecture using the OpenAI Python SDK. It simulates autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex reasoning, decision-making, and task execution with minimal human intervention.

🚀 Features
Modular Agent Design: Easily customizable agent behavior and memory.

Tool Integration: Support for tools like web browsing, file system access, and code execution.

Multi-Agent Communication: Agents can communicate and collaborate on tasks.

Task Planning & Execution: Agents can break down goals, plan subtasks, and complete them step-by-step.

OpenAI SDK: Powered by GPT models via the official OpenAI SDK.

🛠️ Technologies
